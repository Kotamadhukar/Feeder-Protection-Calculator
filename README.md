Feeder Protection Calculator
A web-based engineering tool designed for power system protection analysis. This application provides a streamlined interface for calculating IDMT (Inverse Definite Minimum Time) tripping characteristics and determining directional operating regions for feeder protection relays.

Features
1. IDMT Tripping Time Calculator
Calculate precise tripping times for various standard relay curves.

Supported Curve Types:
Standard Inverse (SI)
Very Inverse (VI)
Extremely Inverse (EI)
Long Time Inverse (LTI)
Inputs: TMS (Time Multiplier Setting), Fault Current, and Set Current.
Output: Instantaneous calculation of the tripping time based on the selected curve characteristics.

2. Directionality & Operating Region
Analyze the directional elements of overcurrent and earth fault protection.
Fault Types: Over Current and Earth Fault directionality.
Phase Selection: Support for individual phases (R, Y, B) or all phases combined.
RCA Adjustment: Custom Relay Characteristic Angle (RCA) input to define the Maximum Torque Line.
Visualizations: Vector diagrams representing the operating and restraining regions.
